 * A chunk is a range of lines in a string based diff

 *
 * Chunks can be used for:
 *  - Correlating diff entries in the base and remote, e.g.
 *    for aligning lines in two editors.
 *  - Finding parts of the unchanged text that are not needed
 *    as context (can be hidden)
 *  - Navigating a diff ("Go to next diff")
